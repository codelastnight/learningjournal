## light information

The first thing i did was to get the correct font size and kerning for the light information. The body copy is Authentic Sans 130, as per the design proposal from last year.

For header we picked 84pt with 87 leading and -35 kerning, and for the body 48pt with 53 leading and -30 kerning.

### i made a font

I made a font for this project. its quite involved so I stuck it in another post. [how did i make this font](/learningjournal/central_station_typeface)

### side mission: a logo

i saw these cool graphics in this archive book and i thought the light information sign would look more "official" if there was a logo on it.

### building it

I got help from Scott and Jamie in the Reid Woodshop to build a wooden version of the stand, as deadlines were closing in (oh no) and Jamie told me that the metals guy (Nick) was not gonna be free until like a week after, and so we couldn't build the metal version in time.

scott actually made the files super quick (i forgot the software he used) and advised on how to make this the fastest, which was to laser cut 6mm mdf.

after this we learned that the deadline was extended (phew)

### this is what it ended up looking like (yay)

## ghost objects

One of the problems with the ghost objects is that we needed an acrylic panel in a specific angle (45deg) fit snugly inside this irregularly shaped dome.

I tried to solve this by assuming that it was a cone, with a sphere replacing the tip. with this in mine, i measured the circumference of the tangent where the sphere and cone line up with a piece of tape, then measuring the tape.
