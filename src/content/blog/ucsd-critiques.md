## this is a super rough draft/unoragnized thoughts. lol. dont read it

"design is not art"
"art feeds the ego; it is a manifestation of self expression. on the other hand, design serves a function."
"ego-centered design vs user/human centered design"
within american technical design schools, this is a statement commonly touted.
example:
https://blog.damato.design/posts/colors-dont-solve-problems/

hypothesis: this line of thought comes the (academic) proximity to silicon valley, with the rise of UX/UI. it gives design an air of "technical"-ness, much like computer science or mechanical engineering. In a way, it was sort of necessary for this to occur, otherwise designers would not be taken seriously in such STEM oriented spaces.
hypothesis 2: much like the software engineers of the silicon valley, user centered designers carry and "ego", preventing them from critiquing the field in a more radical way.

the STEM-ification of design lol.

theres an implication here that designers "solve" problems, much like how one might solve an equasion. however, unlike the law of physics, the foundations for the tools we use are a lot shakier. ethnography, linguistics, psychology, and sociology are all very soft sciences that have many contentions and are constantly challenged. for example in postcolonial circles, ethnography is often challenged as an act of "taking" to serve capital interests without giving back to the communities that the users supposedly are.

UX designers pride themselves in being user-centered instead of ego-centered. I am solving real problems. yet theres a very much the same "ego" needed to think of yourself as somehow better, or more useful then other artists because you know the design thinking infographic.

Theres also the bit where designers often try to solve every problem using design thinking. the idea is that there simply is a more clever solution right around corner, waiting for you, the genius designer, to find. however any brief introduction to the humanities reveals that this cannot be true. There is no clever design solution to low wages. you cannot design your way out of the housing crisis.

the designer is often painted in an individualistic way (this applies groups of designers as well, as they are often small groups within extreamly large organizations/ services). The designer thinks, I matter because i am solving all these problems for so many people. The user-centered designer is self-appointed (or appointed by the capital class) expert "for the people" yet hold no accountability to the people we supposidly serve. We are not democratically voted in, and we do not get penalized for our mistakes. (i am not advocating for desingers to be punished, just pointing out how things are)

In this we can see that the designer as a profession has always been in service to industry and the capital class. we try to balance "different stakeholders", yet at the end of the day, our boss controls who, how, and where we run our user research. our boss controls how much money is spent on these projects, and ultimalty which stakeholders are more important. under a captialist system, ultimately these companies we work for "must" make a profit for shareholders.

hypothesis: user-centered design was only allowed to flourish due to the vast amounts VC money pouring into tech companies during 2000-2020. with a focus on growth rather then profit, tech companies were more then happy to fund ux researchers on how to make products appeal to more people. yet as we see recently, as soon as the pool of cash dries up, every UX innovtion "for the poeple" is suddenly stripped away one by one. from free service turning subscription based, to dark patterns. the same tools we use to make products more accessible is now used to channel clicks into paying for extra seats on plane.

essentially, silicon valley designers lived in a venture captialist's socialist utopia.

this is in opposition to european design schools, which in the last decade has experimented with critical theory ("critical design"). from this new school of though, a fresh line of designers have come about, and the consensus is clear: critical design sucks. ("who can afford to be critical?"). I think this type of criticism of school is important, as it shows that students are able to reflect on their learning.this ultimately makes their own process stronger and advances thinking in students and the institution alike. (maybe. im waffling in this paragraph)
