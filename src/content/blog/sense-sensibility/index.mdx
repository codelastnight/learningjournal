## Research

I did a lot of research for this project, as AI is a hot-button topic with many political and ethical implications. I wrote a separate blog post containing just the research [notes on AI](/learningjournal/notes-on-gen-ai).

For me, I was not really interested in the post-human, conceptual aspect of current AI technology. I follow Lauren Goodlad's words on _critical realism_, meaning we cannot simply ignore how AI affects us today, in the now. Ultimately, I am concerned with current AI systems and their relation to Labor.

> the implementation of AI in the workplace does not only pursue productive outcomes: It also serves to control, transform, and intermediate the labour process. [â€¦]the development of these algorithms is strongly shaped by power relations. Those power relations manifest in the deployment of such algorithms as mechanisms of control.

In reading these papers, I really struggled with trying to reconcile how to use AI in a way that wasn't simply continuing to ignore/perpetuate the very real harm that it causes. My major breakthrough came through when I discovered Sam Lavine through his manifesto _Scrapism_.

Essentially, Sam talks about how the collection of data can be used for political and activist ends. I was really inspired by his work _White collar crime zones_. I really liked how clear and on-the-nose this project was, and it was also presented in a really funny way, such as how the app shows the "average" criminal in that area.

While I originally wanted to collect my own dataset and train my own machine learning system, I obviously didn't have time, nor the skillset to accomplish such a task. After consulting cat, she suggested I should narrow my scope and work with tools that I already had.

I was really struggling with figuring out what I could do with the tools I had.
