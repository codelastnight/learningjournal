**Still in progress; i might change alot from here**

## its all about labor

What i found interesting about views on generative AI, especially among conceptual/new media artists, is how positive they view the technology given the absolute rejection of these tools from online, mostly commercial illustrator and artists, as seen on twitter and the no-AI protest on artstation.

This is what I have most issue with from the article "'can computers be creative?' a misguided question" in which the author posits that we need to take a post-humanist angle to creativity, as we have always used non-human entities to create art with. HOWEVER! I believe this argument is a strawman to the actual issues that workers and artists have over generative AI. People do not necessarily care about whether computers are creative, rather this question is a proxy for labor: will this take my job away?

As with any new technology, this conversation always begins with some allusions to the luddites, and their protest against automation.

### luddites etc.

even modern conversations of luddites still carry this idea of failed anti-innovation prudes who lost to the clear gains from technological innovation. Silicon valley loves to refrence them whenever anyone doubts or critiques the software they develop. I think most ironically, the crypto superbowl commercial from FTX[^cryptosuperbowl] features this mindset.

A brief look at history does reveal that luddites were much more pragmatic and logical in their protests[^luddites]. As skilled machinery workers, they were not really concerned with these new machines, but rather they took issue with the capitalist's attempt to circumvent labor practices of the time[^luddites2].

### generative ai will displace labor

### consequences of displaced labor

## weird ideologies of silicon valley: effective accelerationism

## where do we go from here?

We can look at leftists in the technology space for inspiration.

On their tiktok page, lizthedev argues pursuasivly that generative ai and other machine learning programs from the heart of the silicon valley are inevitable, due to the capital and ideology that the people running these companies possess. They argue therefore, that we the working class must adapt and take advantage as much as possible this technology, otherwise we will only be widening the gap between the boursuasie and proletariat class.
