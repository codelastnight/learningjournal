Looking back at my past design work and their processes, what I found most fun and most exciting was working with my friends. There always comes a point where all of us do not have any good ideas and we devolve into goofing off and making dumb things. This is my favorite part of the design process, and I want to portray that feeling/experience thru this design domain project.

## wiimotes and connections

I was originally thinking of a multiplayer type experience, but I had my doubts on how successfully I could do such a project.

after talking with paul, he suggested using something like a game controller so I could have immediate feedback and a smaller scope on the project.

He also told me about OSC(open sound control) which was a protocol I had no idea about

## the idea

I believe there is meaning-making in the act of collaboration. to struggle to make design together. In the conversations and working together, people can deepen their connections with each other.

### collaboration

I think about the [Exhibition _It all starts with a thread_](https://mawithathread.mmm.page/) at the Whitechapel Gallery of london that I visited. One of the works features the artists[^threadartists] with various collaborative pieces.

In particular, Raisa Kabir’s moving image piece, House Made of Tin stands out. In this piece, multiple people work together on a loom. As the documentation reveals, the struggle to collectively weave the piece together created a "physical support structure [...] completely woven, connects us all."[^houseoftin]

From the intentional struggle of weaving as a practice, creates understanding and connection with people.

### imprecision

Interesting and unexpected designs emerge from the glitchiness and imprecisions of the tools. Furthermore, this gives an air of silliness to the project.

#### aside: its important to stay unserious and silly

I know there is great irony in talking about silliness in design through a completely serious manner, but I feel like people are misunderstanding my position.

Its important to present design as unserious wherever possible. From its inception design has been a tool of the state. Ruben Pater talks about how the graphic designer was used to break the power of the printmaking unions. The Star Designer is exclusive, a creative genius, a lone wolf alpha male.

Drawing from [Design Justice Principles](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles), I use sillyness to redefine the designer from an expert into a facilitator. This removes the air of importance that often causes people to be hesitant to participate in design. "Come and join! its not that serious" is the vibe I am going for.

### so... the idea?

the big idea is that I want to design an experience that is

1. collaboative
2. about making art/design
3. uses the wiimotes

The importance of the wiimotes is in their lack of precision, and their familiarity to users. PIcking up a wiimote needs less explanation.

SO my big idea was to either:

1. make a figma-like "design" tool that lets players drag around elements, but the elements will have a physics applied to them, letting them bounce around.
2. a "suburban home" builder for 2 players, using 3d models to make glitched and fucked up building plans. (this would fit in with some of my other ideas floating in my head)

I decided to go with idea #1, as it seemed easier to implement something in 2d. This also meant I could use a javascript stack for 2d, making it easier for me to put something together. I also thought perhaps I was overloading with the ideas on the second prompt.

This video from artist Nikita Diakur inspired me to use the physics engine:

import { YouTube } from "@astro-community/astro-embed-youtube";

<YouTube id='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zUJzzRu-xs' />

I thought this would be interesting to implement, as there are really unexpected and uncontrollable effects that occur from the chaos of physics engines. I think this adds to the imprecision I am aiming for.

## wiimotes and windows

So, from this I decided to figure out connecting windows pcs and wiimotes

The first thing I did was try using wiiUPro, which did not work at all. I got the wiimote to connect, but it did not output any information that I could use.

The next thing I tried was GlovePIE, which was promising. It had a scripting interface that let me export the native wiimote commands into something other programs could understand. However, it had a limited number of things it supported as an outout, lke X-input. OSC was broken in the latest version of GlovePIE.

I thought i would have to hack something together with x-input, but then a savior appeared from the horizon: Chataigne, a french "orchestration" software used by installation and new media artists. This app had wiimote support, and let me export that data into a number of protocols, including OSC but more convenient for me, websockets. This means I have much more freedom in the software stack I want to use to make this work.

### uh oh (limitations)

I realized too late (day before the showcase) that Chataigne, for whatever reason, wasn't able to detect motionPlus, despite other software being able to do so. I submitted a bug report, but I havent seen
