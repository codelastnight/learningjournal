Looking back at my past design work and their processes, what I found most fun and most exciting was working with my friends. There always comes a point where all of us do not have any good ideas and we devolve into goofing off and making dumb things. This is my favorite part of the design process, and I want to portray that feeling/experience thru this design domain project.

## wiimotes and connections

I was originally thinking of a multiplayer type experience, but I had my doubts on how successfully I could do such a project.

after talking with paul, he suggested using something like a game controller so I could have immediate feedback and a smaller scope on the project.

He also told me about OSC(open sound control) which was a protocol I had no idea about

So, from this I decided to figure out connecting windows pcs and wiimotes (not an easy task)

The first thing I did was try using wiiUPro, which did not work at all. I got the wiimote to connect, but it did not output any information that I could use.

The next thing I tried was GlovePIE, which was promising. It had a scripting interface that let me export the native wiimote commands into something other programs could understand. However, it had a limited number of things it supported as an outout, lke X-input. OSC was broken in the latest version of GlovePIE.

I thought i would have to hack something together with x-input, but then a savior appeared from the horizon: Chataigne, a french "orchestration" software used by installation and new media artists. This app had wiimote support, and let me export that data into a number of protocols, including OSC but more convenient for me, websockets. This means I have much more freedom in the software stack I want to use to make this work.

## the idea

the big idea is that I want to design an experience that is

1. collaboative
2. about making art/design
3. uses the wiimotes

SO my big idea was to either:

1. make a figma-like "design" tool that lets players drag around elements, but the elements will have a physics applied to them, letting them bounce around.
2. a "suburban home" builder for 2 players, using 3d models to make glitched and fucked up building plans.

I decided to go with idea #1, as it seemed easier to implement something in 2d. This also meant I could use a javascript stack for 2d, making it easier for me to put something together.

This video inspired me to use the physics engine:
