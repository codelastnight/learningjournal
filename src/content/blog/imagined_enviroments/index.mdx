## what i started with

Thematically, I imagine my childhood, from the internet to physical space, thinking thru my various identities over time. The jarring in the final video is intentional, similar to how tiktok videos have very disjointed moods and feelings.

originally, i was imagining how it feels to go through tiktok: overstimulated by information, video, and images. with each swipe, you can go from a cute cat video to videos on police violence.

I was also thinking of my roots on home, and what it meant to be from the american suburbs.

## inspo

So I saw this video on tiktok and i was like, i need to recreate this:

import tiktokvideo from "./VID-20231023-WA0003.mp4";

<Video src={tiktokvideo} autoplay={false} width={"360px"} />

I am very inspired by this creator nohluhn (also its crazy the cultural production of k-pop fans):

<YouTube id='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRTkIEf7Oo' />

also has a making-of:

### the plan

so the plan is to make 2-3 different scenes, around 30s each. (1:30 is a long time!) I can make an intro, and and also a credit sequence to cut down on the actual amount of time for the content.

To me, learning after effects, which is a new software to me, was a larger priority then to make a cohesive piece. I wanted to mess around and learn specific techniques.

## the cat video section

I downloaded some cat videos, keyed out the green, and placed them around the screen in after effects. for whatever reason after effects could not handle the amount of cats on screen (too many cats!)

so this was all i could muster:

import video4 from "./Cats World 1-4.webm";

<Video src={video4} />

First thing I tried was using mocha to track video and get the "camera shake" to transfer over to the scene. This turned out to be a very difficult task. For one, I had a hard time getting the tracking data out of the mocha plugin into a useable form of data.

After effects, unlike 3d software, doesnt use cameras, but layers. So this proved difficult to get all the objects to move in the way that i wanted. I was able to get the virtual camera to move, but not in a way that made any sense.

So after an hour of agonizing over this, I gave up and moved to blender. I already knew how to track videos in blender, so this was a breeze.

The images back here are windows 7 wallpapers.

import video2 from "./0770-5605-1.webm";

<Video src={video2} />

From this I added a bunch of videos as textures to planes, making sure to modify the shader to emit no shadows, have the color route to emission on top of the matte, and to route the alpha data into the alpha shader.

import video1 from "./1553-4821-2.webm";

<Video src={video1} />

To get the "soft edge" look for the background images and videos, I created a bw picture going from white to black, and used that as an alpha mask on the shader. delightfully clunky.

## creating the title card.

I was looking at chinese tea graphics from the local chinese supermarket. these kitchy designs are often the inspiration for many great chinese designers (other asian countries have this too, but have a different aesthetic language).

![chinese tea graphics](<./Screenshot 2023-12-01 145222.jpg>)

I wanted to replicate the emotion of looking at these designs thru an intro sequence. with a lotus flower included, of course.

I learned how to use the Puppet Pin tool to move the grass in a hypnotic way. The metro flowers are a video clip

import titlecard from "./Sky And Grass-6(1).webm";

<Video src={titlecard} />

This also reminds me of chinese ads i used to watch between my cartoons at my grandparents home in hangzhou.

### title part 2

I was looking at early windows-7 type images:
![frutiger aero inspo](<./Screenshot 2023-12-01 142543.jpg>)

like i know frutiger aero/metro is like suuuper in rn so its like, im following trends or whatever but i still think it looks cool + has very personal nostalgia for me. ([i talk about this later](#this-isnt-really-original-enviromentalism) ) The technological optimism and digitized nature is something that as a child, I was enamoured by. It is impossible to see technology today thru this lens.

I replicated the playstation screen from the inspiration video with a box and a wave filter. I used a gradient for the fill, achieving the desired look.

I learned how to manually manipulate the keyfames to get the super curved interpolations.

To get the dogs to show up, I used a script from an online tutorial to stagger and copy the animation keyframes. I'm not sure if this is the fastest way to do this but I think it works alright.

## embracing my american roots

something Ive been thinking about recently is identity as asian-american. I have always accepted my asian side of myself (i am ethnically chinese and japanese). however, I grew up in america, and am socialized as so. I wouldn't fit in if i go to china or japan. My personality, politics, language are shaped from where I grew up in, the pacific northwest.

I'm not necessarily proud to be american. my laundry list of critiques on imperial america only gets longer as time passes. Unfortunately at the end of the day, I am american. I cannot ignore this part of myself, as being american shapes who i am today..

### thinking suburbs with underscores & jane remover's Uncanny Long Arms.

So this is the song:

<YouTube id='https://youtu.be/BYpKQ65DugI' />

These two trans artists are some of my biggest influences. Their exploration of noise, punk, indie rock from an EDM producer lens got my thinking cap on real good. What did it mean to grow up in an american suburb, a place devoid of social interaction and culture? This also relates heavily with Seattle's architecture, which is known to not have a local vernacular, instead being made of cheap constructionist buildings and starter kit homes from the east.

I realized i didnt have much footage of my hometown, so I got my google maps open and recorded myself exploring the area.

import video3 from "./2023-11-02 23-23-10-3.webm";

<Video src={video3} />

Inspired by local punk/indie rock music videos (additionally jane remover), i treated this clip with a noise filter and a "echo" filter to mimic a low-shutter speed camera.

import video5 from "./Sadsadasdasdasd-5.webm";

<Video src={video5} />

you can see the local mall i used to visit every day lol.

## supporting graphics

As I worked thru this project I realized I wanted to be more cohesive to a theme, and from what I was thinking about, I wanted to embrace more of the "northwest" aesthetic ( as seen above).

I was inspired by companies like REI, and also this store near my friends family home in Blaine, Washington.

![](<./image 4.jpg>)

So I invented a fictional company, cleverly named "Pacific Interaction Systems". I used it across the video in various forms.

## this isn't really... original (+enviromentalism)

its not, and i think thats ok. this work especially is very derivative of my influences. Social media has designers competing with each other on a global stage, creating objects faster, newer, special-er, unique-er, and even faster. I think this feeds into the same consumerism as fast fashion. Can designers think degrowth? I think this is what I am trying to accomplish with my practice. While of course (obviously) I cannot be un-influenced by the social media feed (tiktok and pinterest are directly wired in my brain), I try to make an effort to "source locally". beyond recording my local home on google maps, microsoft is also headquartered in redmond, a couple miles away from my house.

One thing to note about where I grew up, in the suburbs(ish), is the lack of a "unique" environment. Factoria does not have a local architecture vernacular, instead the designs are shipped from the east coast (eg, sears modern homes). What does embracing a homeland, one that is essentially a copy-paste across the west, look like?

## final video.

import final from "./All Together 1-1.webm";

this is the final video[^compression].

<Video src={final} autoplay={false} />

[^compression]: for future reference: I used handbrake to compress videos, using the webm container, codec vb8, at bitrate of 1000 w/ 2-passes. this compressed the videos down to a decent size ({'<10'} mb).
