import Video from "../../../components/Video.astro";

## intro

conceptually i was imagining how it feels to go through tiktok: overstimulated by information, video, and images. with each swipe, you can go from a cute cat video to videos on police violence.

## inspo

So I saw this video on tiktok and i was like, i need to recreate this:

import tiktokvideo from "./VID-20231023-WA0003.mp4";

<Video src={tiktokvideo} autoplay={false} width={"360px"} />

I am very inspired by this creator nohluhn (also its crazy the cultural production of k-pop fans):

<YouTube id='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRTkIEf7Oo' />

also has a making-of:

I was looking at early windows-7 type images:

and also chinese tea graphics

like i know fruger aero/metro is like suuuper in rn so its like, im following trends or whatever but i still think it looks cool + has very personal nostalgia for me.

### the plan

so the plan is to make 2-3 different scenes, around 30s each. (1:30 is a long time!) I can make an intro, and and also a credit sequence to cut down on the actual amount of time for the content.

To me, learning after effects, which is a new software to me, was a larger priority then to make a cohesive piece. I wanted to mess around to learn specific techniques.

## the cat video section

import video1 from "./1553-4821-2.webm";

<Video src={video1} />

import video2 from "./0770-5605-1.webm";

<Video src={video2} />

import video3 from "./2023-11-02 23-23-10-3.webm";

<Video src={video3} />
